<p class="ph3">BY A DWELLER IN THE EAST.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Everybody</span> who has read anything about the
East must be acquainted with the plague of
locusts. I distinctly remember that when a small
boy I was more impressed by the accounts of the
enormous extent of their flocks than with anything
else my books could tell me. There was
to me something appalling, and at the same time
attractive, in the swarms stretching for miles,
which obscured the sun, and devoured everything
green wherever they settled. It is difficult, if
not impossible, for any one brought up in our
temperate regions to realise such a state of things.
We hear, to be sure, of damage done to crops at
home; just now, it is sparrows; not very long
since it was game; next year it may be something
else; but in all these cases it is simply damage—perhaps
one per cent., or five per cent., or ten
per cent. But with locusts it means not damage,
but destruction, or, better still, annihilation of
the crop. Fancy an English farmer turning out
after breakfast and admiring his six-acre field
of wheat, deliciously green, about two feet high.
Fancy him, too, coming home to dinner at noon
and seeing this same field as bare as his hand.
This is no exaggeration, but a plain matter-of-fact
illustration of what may be seen any spring
where these abominable insects abound. Once
seen, it can never be forgotten.</p>

<p>I have had my recollection of these creatures
and their ways revived by a parliamentary paper
entitled, ‘Report of the Locust Campaign of 1884,
by Mr S. Brown, Government Engineer, Cyprus.’
It gives the results of the measures employed to
stay the plague to which the island has for ages
been subject; and so far it is satisfactory enough.
The locusts have been put down, and for most
people that is the chief point. I notice that the
<i>Times</i> has devoted about half a column to the
paper, but has contented itself with simply copying
the salient points, the writer evidently
knowing nothing of the subject. The paper
itself presupposes a knowledge of a certain nature,
which no one except those who are acquainted
with the district can be expected to possess. I
venture, therefore, to supply the information
necessary to a thorough understanding of the
subject.</p>

<p>Speaking as a dweller in the East, I may say
that we have had the locusts with us always. In
the old old days, they were sent by the gods; in
less remote times, they were a dispensation of
Providence. They came and went, leaving lamentable
traces of their progress. But it was in
the nature of things that it should be so, and
nobody ever thought of trying if something could
not be done to stop their ravages. Under
Turkish rule, of course this feeling was intensified
by the fatalism peculiar to their faith. The
locusts came of their own accord, and went off
in the same way; it was <i>kismet</i>, and there was
nothing to be done. But even Mohammedans
in time cannot escape altogether the influence of
Western ideas, and some thirty years ago it
occurred to Osman Pasha, then governor of Cyprus,
to try and make head against the scourge which
devastated the island. He was earnest in the
cause, but unfortunately died before measures
could possibly have had any effect. His successors,
as a rule, talked a great deal, but, after the manner
of their race, did nothing. A tax was imposed
on the peasants, which was to be devoted to the
purchase and destruction of locusts’ eggs. This
was all very well; but as the officials helped
themselves to from fifty to ninety per cent. of the
money collected, very little impression was made
on the swarms. And then, again, as three parts
sand and one part eggs did duty as eggs, it is
not to be wondered at that the insects were as
plentiful as ever.</p>

<p>So things went on till about fifteen years
ago, when Said Pasha became governor. He
kept on the system of buying eggs, but with
this important difference, that when he paid for
eggs he saw that he got them. He put some
Europeans on the Commission of superintendence,
had the eggs stored, and authorised their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_802">{802}</span>
destruction only after his personal inspection.
The proceedings were open to the light of day,
and everything was done to prevent imposition.
The result was admirable; in three years, locusts’
eggs were as valuable as those of the silkworm;
and in 1870, it was officially reported that the
insect had ceased to exist in Cyprus. This, however,
proved to be an exaggeration. No doubt,
a great impression had been made; swarms were
no longer to be met with by the ordinary traveller;
but it is plain that a good many did
remain in out-of-the-way and difficult districts.</p>

<p>In 1872 it was reported that locusts were
reappearing. This was pronounced to be a
calumny, and the observers were referred to
the official Report, showing that the locust
had ceased to exist in Cyprus—which, of course,
was conclusive! In 1875, however, denial was
no longer possible; no one with eyes in his head
could doubt the existence of countless myriads
of plundering insects. Said Pasha by this time
had left the island, and his successor was of a
different character, and did nothing to stop their
increase, which accordingly went on unchecked
till the British occupation in 1878. As may be
imagined, the question very soon engaged the
attention of the authorities, and a determined
set was made against the creatures. In the
autumn of 1879, thirty-seven and a half tons
of eggs were collected and destroyed, and in the
spring of that year an enormous number of insects
were trapped. In 1880 larger swarms than ever
appeared, a great many of which were trapped,
and two hundred and thirty-six tons of their
eggs collected. In 1881 the locusts came in still
greater numbers, and in the autumn and winter,
thirteen hundred and thirty tons of eggs were
destroyed. It was evident that what had been
done was a trifle; exceptional measures were
declared to be necessary, and preparations were
accordingly made on a very large scale for the
campaign of 1882. It was shown that egg-collecting
alone was not to be depended upon.
One may think that this affords the easiest means
of destruction, and so it does, if you can be sure
of getting at all the eggs. But the breeding-grounds
are situated in remote and rugged districts,
to patrol which properly means a very
large supply of labour, and even then it becomes
a mere question of eyesight, which often fails.
Up to a certain stage in its existence the insect
creeps but cannot fly, and it is then that it must
be taken. Trapping the non-flying insects is therefore
the feature which forms the salient matter of
Mr Brown’s Report, but which will not be understood
by the public without explanation.</p>

<p>The Report opens with a statement of the
material employed. This consisted of two thousand
canvas screens, each fifty yards long; one
hundred thousand five hundred square yards of
canvas for screens; twelve thousand six hundred
and eleven square yards oilcloth; twenty tons zinc
for traps; and seventy-six thousand one hundred
and eighty-three stakes for the screens, besides
cordage and other minor articles. As the reports
from the breeding districts came in, it was thought
this supply would prove insufficient, and Mr
Brown therefore caused one thousand additional
screens to be made up, and three thousand seven
hundred and eighty traps of a new type to be
cut out of the zinc received from England. The
total apparatus, therefore, when operations began,
amounted to eleven thousand and eighty-three
screens, each fifty yards long; and thirteen thousand
and eight traps; with the necessary complement
of stakes, tools, and tents for labourers.
To give an idea of the total length of the screens,
it may be mentioned, that if stretched continuously
they would form a line three hundred and
fifteen miles long, almost enough to encircle the
whole island. In order to work all this material,
labour was necessary, and accordingly contracts
were made to a maximum of thirteen hundred
and ninety-eight labourers.</p>

<p>This is all very interesting; but what is the
meaning of it? What are screens? What is
canvas wanted for? What do they do with oilcloth?
And what sort of traps do they make
out of zinc? This is what Mr Brown does not
tell us, and this is exactly the information which
I propose to supply. The first step in the process
is to begin with a little natural history.</p>

<p>The female locust is provided with a sort of
sword-like appendage, with which she makes a
hole in the ground, in which she deposits her
eggs. Over these she exudes a glutinous matter,
which hardens by exposure, in time forming a
case impervious to wet, cold, or even fire, the
whole resembling a small silk cocoon. The
number of eggs in each of these is variously
estimated; some say a hundred, others eighty;
but Mr Brown by actual experiment finds that
the average may be taken at thirty-two, and that
the sexes are produced in about equal proportion.
It is not difficult, therefore, to calculate the rate
of increase, allowing fifty per cent. to be lost
through the operation of natural causes, birds,
caterpillars, &amp;c. A couple of locusts will thus
produce sixteen individuals or eight couples the
first year; next year, the product will be a hundred
and twenty-eight, or sixty-four couples; the
third year, eight times that; and so on—a calculation
which may be carried on to any length
you like, and which will explain the countless
myriads which everybody has heard of.</p>

<p>The female having performed her duty in
reproducing her species, is of no further use, and
both she and her partner disappear—that is to
say, they both die. It is a popular belief in
Cyprus that the male eats the female and dies
of the consequent indigestion. But a more
scientific explanation of the fact is, that as by
the end of July—beyond which locusts are never
seen—everything green is burnt up by the sun,
their food fails, and they die of starvation.
There is no mistake about their death; every
open pool of water is full of them, and the stench
is abominable, and one may walk along the coast
for miles amongst their dead bodies, washed up
by the sea. The eggs remain in the ground till
hatched by the warmth of the spring sun, which
brings them out early in March. If the season
should be cold or wet, the only effect is to
delay the hatching; the eggs never appear to get
addled. At the beginning of April this year the
swarms were on the march, and operations began,
and were continued till the 13th of May, when all
that were left were on the wing. It is by taking
advantage of the habits of the creature that the
greatest success in its destruction is achieved.
The young locusts as soon as they can crawl go
in search of green food. Impelled by this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_803">{803}</span>
instinct, they go straight on, turning neither to
the right nor to the left. They are remarkably
short of sense; they can do nothing but follow
their nose, and have not an idea of turning a
corner. If a locust on the march were to meet
with a lamp-post, he would never think of going
round it, but would climb up to the top and
come down on the other side. It is by taking
advantage of this steady plodding perseverance
that the arch-inventor Man makes the creature
work its own destruction. Some twenty
years ago, Mr Richard Mattei, an Italian gentleman,
and large landed proprietor in Cyprus, made
various experiments, which have resulted in the
employment of the screens and traps which are
mentioned in Mr Brown’s Report. The manner
of operation is as follows.</p>

<p>In early spring, it was reported to headquarters
that one hundred and thirty-three breeding-grounds
had been discovered. Each of these was
therefore screened off by a ring-fence. The screens
are formed of canvas about two feet high, on the
top of which are sewn about four inches of oilcloth.
These are arranged so as to form a zigzag
with angles of about one hundred and thirty-five
degrees. At intervals, pits are dug of a regulation
size—a cubic yard—so as to facilitate computation.
The locusts on the march come up to
the screen, climb up the canvas, get on to the
oilcloth, and straightway slip down. Nothing
daunted, they try again, again, and again, each
time edging a little nearer to the angle. Arriving
here at last, they find a pit, into which they fall
or jump. Naturally, they climb up again; but
find at the top a framework of wood, lined on
the inside with sheet-zinc, on which they cannot
walk, and consequently they fall back into the
pit. Imagine thousands of the creatures all
doing this at the same time, and the result will
be, of course, that one-half smothers the other
half, and in its turn gets smothered by a few
spadefuls of earth, which the labourer, always on
the watch, takes care to apply at the proper
moment. The pit is then full, and is counted as
such in the daily report. Mr Brown gives full
details. The ‘full’ pits contained a depth of
eighteen inches of locusts; pits three-quarters,
one-half, one-quarter, and one-eighth full were
returned as such, and when reduced to ‘full’ pits,
the total number amounted to fifteen thousand
nine hundred and nineteen. The whole number,
however, of pits in which locusts were trapped
was twenty-six thousand and sixteen, and the
total number of pits dug far exceeded this.</p>

<p>Every pains was taken to arrive at a correct
account of the number of locusts thus destroyed,
and the number for this year is set down at the
enormous total of fifty-six thousand one hundred
and sixteen millions. Last year the number
was computed approximately at one hundred
and ninety-five thousand millions. With such a
destruction, it was believed that this year the
swarms would be less; and this anticipation was
fully realised, less than one-third appearing of
what was visible in 1883. This is extremely
satisfactory, when we find that the swarms of
1883 were as numerous as those of 1882, which
in their turn greatly exceeded those of 1881. In
fact, up to 1883 the locusts had been gaining
ground; now they are losing it; and it only needs
care and watchfulness on our part to thoroughly
exterminate them, or at anyrate to render them
practically harmless. For if the locust can only
find food, it will not travel; they march simply
in order to get wherewith to support existence;
and if they can find enough near their birthplace,
they will stop there. But of course this cannot
be allowed, when we think of their multiplication
next year and the years after. No; it is a
question of war to the ‘pit.’ Efforts must not
be relaxed; the system of reports from the
breeding districts will still be continued; and
the supply of screens and traps must always be
ready for use.</p>

<p>This year, the large supply of material was
used in a much more careful and methodical way
than in any previous year. Some idea of the
extent of the operations may be gathered from
the fact that in one district—that of Tchingerli—there
was a continuous line of screens without
a break for twenty-seven miles in length, arranged
in three great loops connected by a common
centre. Another breeding-ground was surrounded
by screens sixteen miles long; and there were
many other similar cases. With screens thus fixed,
with plenty of pits, and with careful supervision,
the destruction should be complete. Accidents,
however, will occur, some of which are preventable,
whilst others are not. Heavy rains and floods,
for instance, swept away some of the screens; and
there were also cloudy and windy days, when
the locusts will not march, and of course will not
fill the pits. No doubt, occasion was taken on
such days to help in the destruction by manual
labour; every little helps; and it is not difficult
to slay one’s thousands and tens of thousands
when the victims are all close together. It is
not unusual to meet the creatures in a body a
mile wide and a mile deep. They are about
an inch and a quarter long, and a quarter of
an inch wide, and march with an interval of
about an inch, progressing some half-mile a day.</p>

<p>One would think that the importance of information
to headquarters would be patent to everybody
in the island; yet such is the apathy, not
to say stupidity, of some of the islanders, that
Mr Brown was surprised and disgusted to hear
that whilst operations were at the height, locusts
had been discovered at the extreme east point
of the island, which had been reported free. Not
only so, but no locusts had existed within thirty-five
miles, nor had any been seen flying in that
direction. Material was at once forwarded, but
unfortunately too late, as the insects had almost
arrived at the flying stage, when nothing can
be done. One might as well try to reduce midges
by squashing them between the hands. The district
was found to be only a small one—less than
half a mile in diameter. It may safely be left
next year to Mr Brown’s tender care.</p>

<p>What is the result of all this time, trouble,
and expense? You could traverse the locust
area and see very few; whereas in May and
June of previous years you might ride through
flights some of which would cover an area of
several square miles. The small number that
are left are thinly scattered over a comparatively
small area, and as they find sufficient food in
the natural grasses, they do not migrate. This
year, up to August not a single flight has been
seen, and best of all, nothing has been heard
of damage to the crops. It is calculated that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_804">{804}</span>
survivors of this year do not amount to more
than one per cent. of those of last year. The
problem, therefore, appears to be solved; all
that is necessary is a small annual expenditure
to keep the material and labour in working
order.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was but a few minutes past seven o’clock
when Jules tapped at the door of Madame De
Vigne’s boudoir. The summons was responded
to by Nanette. ‘Monsieur De Miravel’s compliments
to Madame De Vigne, and would she
grant monsieur the honour of an interview for
a few minutes?’</p>

<p>The answer came at once: ‘Madame De Vigne
was ready to receive Monsieur De Miravel.’</p>

<p>Daylight was waning, and although the Venetians
were drawn half-way up the windows, the
room was in twilight. To De Miravel it seemed
almost in darkness as he went in; but in a few
moments his eyes became more accustomed to
the semi-obscurity, and he then perceived his
wife standing in the middle of the floor—a tall,
black-robed figure, crowned by a face whose
extreme pallor, seen by that half-light, would
have seemed like that of a dead woman, but for
the two large, intensely glowing eyes which
lighted it up.</p>

<p>After his first momentary hesitation, De Miravel
advanced a few steps and made one of his elaborate
bows. Madame De Vigne responded by a grave
inclination of her head, and motioning her visitor
to a chair, sat down herself on an ottoman some
distance away. In the silence, not yet broken
by either of them, they heard the low, far-away
muttering of thunder among the hills.</p>

<p>De Miravel was the first to speak. ‘I am
desolated, madame, to have been under the necessity
of seeking this interview,’ he said. ‘But I
have been waiting, waiting, waiting till I have
grown tired. I am tired of being here alone in
this great hotel, where I know no one. It is now
two days since I spoke to you. You know my
proposition. <i>Eh bien!</i> I choose to wait no longer;
I am here for your answer.’ He spoke the last
words with a kind of snarl, which for the moment
brought his long, white, wolfish-looking teeth
prominently into view.</p>

<p>‘As you say, I am fully acquainted with your
proposition,’ answered Mora in cold, quiet, unfaltering
tones. ‘But you know well how hateful
to me are the conditions which you wish to
impose. I think I made that point clear to you
on Wednesday.’</p>

<p>‘You were in a passion on Wednesday. I
heeded not what you said.’</p>

<p>‘But I meant every word that I said. In view
of that fact, and knowing what you know—may
I ask whether in the interim you have not
seen some way by which those conditions may
be modified—some way by which, without injury
to what you conceive to be your interests, they
may be made less objectionable to me?’</p>

<p>He shook his head impatiently. ‘You are
only wasting my time and yours,’ he said. ‘When
I have said a thing, I mean it. As the conditions
were on Wednesday, even so they are now—altered
in nothing. If you cannot comply with
them, tell me so at once, and at once I will seek
out Sir William. Ah ha! Mademoiselle Clarice
had better wait awhile before she orders the robe
for her wedding!’</p>

<p>She heard him apparently unmoved. There
was not a flash, not as much as a flicker to be
seen of the passion which had so possessed her
on Wednesday. Her quietude surprised him, and
rendered him vaguely uneasy.</p>

<p>‘Consider, Laroche—before it is too late.’</p>

<p>‘Too late?’ he muttered under his breath.
‘<i>Peste!</i> What can she mean?’</p>

<p>‘You know how utterly impossible it is that
I should live with you for one day, or even one
hour, as your wife,’ continued Mora. ‘You know
that I would sooner seek a refuge in the dark
waters of yonder lake. Why, then, strive to
make a desperate woman more desperate? And
my sister!—she has never harmed you, she does
not even know of your existence. Why try to
wreck the happiness of her life, as you wrecked
mine? Why try to shatter the fair future that
lies before her? To do so can in nowise benefit
you. Consider—think again before you finally
decide. Have pity on this child, even though
you have none on me. Ah, Laroche, you never
had a sister, or you would know something of
that which I feel!’</p>

<p>‘This is child’s play,’ he exclaimed with a
sneer. ‘We are wasting time. A strong man
makes use of others to effect his ends. I make
use of you and your sister. I have said.’ He
was convinced by this time that her quietude
was merely that of despair—the quietude of a
criminal who submits to the hands of the
executioner.</p>

<p>‘Listen, Laroche!’ she continued in the same
icy, impassive tones. ‘Although I am not what
the world calls rich, I am not without means,
as you are aware. Give me your promise to
leave England, and never to seek out or in any
way annoy either my sister or me, and half of
all I am possessed of shall be settled upon you.
It will be an income for life which nothing can
rob you of.’</p>

<p>An eager, greedy light leaped into his eyes.
‘What do you call an income, dear madame?’
he said. ‘How many thousand francs a year
would you be prepared to settle on your brave
Hector?’</p>

<p>‘Six thousand francs a year would be about
half my income.’</p>

<p>‘Six thousand francs! And my wife’s sister
married to the son of one of the richest <i>milords</i>
in England! <i>Chut!</i> Do you take your Hector
for an imbecile?’ He rose, crossed to the pier-glass
over the chimneypiece, adjusted his scarf
in front of it, and then went back to his chair.
‘Do you know what is now the great ambition
of your Hector’s life?’ he asked, gazing fixedly
at her out of his half-shut eyes. ‘But no—how
should you? Listen, then, and I will tell you.
It is to be introduced to two, three, or more of
the great London clubs where they occupy themselves
with what you English call “high play.”
Sir William or his son shall introduce me—when
I am of their family. Six thousand francs a
year! <i>Parbleu!</i> when once I have the <i>entrée</i>
to two or three of the <i>cercles</i> I speak of, my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_805">{805}</span>
income will be nearer sixty than six thousand
francs a year.’</p>

<p>‘If such are your views, if this is the course
you are determined to pursue, I am afraid that
any further appeal by me would be utterly thrown
away.’</p>

<p>‘Utterly thrown away, <i>ma belle</i>, an absolute
waste of time, as I said before.’</p>

<p>‘I felt convinced from the first that it would
be so.’</p>

<p>‘Ah! Then why amuse yourself at my expense
in the way you have?’</p>

<p>‘It was not by way of amusing myself that
I appealed to you, but for the ease of my conscience
in the days yet to come.’</p>

<p>He stared at her suspiciously for a moment
or two, then he said with a shrug: ‘I do not
comprehend you.’</p>

<p>She rose and pushed back her chair. ‘There
is nothing more to be said. I need not detain
you further.’</p>

<p>He too rose, but for once he was evidently
nonplussed. ‘Nothing more to be said?’ he
remarked after a pause. ‘It seems to me that
there is much more to be said. I have not yet
had your answer to the proposition I laid before
you on Wednesday last.’</p>

<p>‘I thought you understood. But if you want
my answer in a few plain words, you shall have
it.’</p>

<p>In the twilight he could see her clear shining
eyes gazing steadily and fearlessly into his.
Craven fears began to flutter round his heart.</p>

<p>‘Hector Laroche, you have lost much time
and put yourself to much trouble and expense
in hunting down a woman whose life, years ago,
you made a burden almost too bitter for her to
bear—and all to no purpose. You have found
me; what then? You have made a proposition
to me so utterly vile as altogether to defeat your
own ends. From this hour I know you not.
I will never see or speak to you again. It will
be at your peril to attempt to molest me. I
have friends who will see that I suffer no harm
at your hands. There is the door. Begone!’</p>

<p>‘Ho, ho!’ he cried with an hyena-like snarl.
‘You bid me begone, do you? <i>Eh bien!</i> I must
not disobey a lady’s commands. I will go—but
it shall be in search of Sir William.’</p>

<p>‘Your search need not take you far; Sir
William Ridsdale is here, under this roof.’</p>

<p>Laroche could not repress a start of surprise.
He was still staring at Mora like a man at an
utter loss what to say next, when a tap was
heard at the door, which was followed a moment
later by the entrance of Nanette: ‘Sir William
Ridsdale has sent word to say that he should
like to see Monsieur De Miravel as soon as that
gentleman is at liberty to wait upon him.’</p>

<p>‘Monsieur De Miravel is at liberty to wait
upon Sir William at once,’ said Madame De Vigne
in clear, staccato tones.—‘Nanette, conduct monsieur
to Sir William’s apartment.’</p>

<p>Laroche scowled at her for a moment. Then
he said in a low voice: ‘Do you set me at
defiance? Is it really that I am to tell Sir
William everything?’</p>

<p>‘Yes; I set you at defiance. Tell Sir William
all that you know. <i>Scélerat!</i> do your worst.’</p>

<p>The scowl on his face deepened; his lips
twitched, but no sound came from them. Madame
De Vigne’s finger pointed to the open door at
which Nanette was standing. Laroche turned on
his heel and walked out of the room with the air
of a whipped cur.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>By this time it was nearly dark; the evening
was close and sultry; distant thunder reverberated
among the hills; there was the menace
of a storm in the air. The grounds of the hotel
were deserted, and just at present the house was
as quiet as though it were some lonely country
mansion, instead of a huge hostelry overflowing
with guests. It was the hour consecrated to one
of the most solemn duties of existence, and, with
few exceptions, the flock of more or less hungry
birds of passage were engaged in the pleasing
process of striving to recuperate exhausted nature
by means of five courses and a dessert.</p>

<p>Nanette, after conducting Laroche to Sir
William’s room, was on her way back to light
the lamp in her mistress’s boudoir, when, as she
turned a corner of the corridor, she was suddenly
confronted by Jules, between whom and herself,
as being of the same nationality, a pleasant little
flirtation was already in full swing. The meeting
was so sudden and the corridor so dusky, that
the girl started, and a low cry broke from her
lips.</p>

<p>‘Hist! do not make a noise, I beg of you,
ma’amselle,’ whispered Jules; ‘but tell me, is
madame in her room and alone?’ His face
looked very pale in the twilight, and Nanette
could see that he was strangely moved.</p>

<p>‘Madame is in her room, but she is indisposed,
and cannot see any one this evening—unless,’
she added archly, a moment after, ‘the business
of monsieur with her is of very, very great
importance.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, believe me, dear ma’amselle, it is of the
very greatest importance. Do not delay, I beg
of you! Any moment I may be missed from
the <i>salle</i> and asked for. Tell madame that the
affair I want to see her upon is one of life and
death.’</p>

<p>The girl stared at him for a moment, and then
went.</p>

<p>He stole noiselessly after her and waited outside
the door. Presently the door opened, and
Nanette beckoned to him to enter. He went in,
and found himself alone with Madame De Vigne.</p>

<p>‘Pardon the question, madame,’ said Jules;
‘but may I ask whether the gentleman—Monsieur
De Miravel he calls himself—who left this room
a few minutes ago is a friend of madame?’</p>

<p>Madame became suddenly interested. ‘I have
been acquainted with the person you name for a
great number of years,’ she replied after a
moment’s hesitation.</p>

<p>‘Madame would not like any harm to happen
to Monsieur De Miravel?’</p>

<p>‘Harm? No; certainly not. I should not
like harm to happen to any one. But your question
is a strange one. Tell me why you ask it.’</p>

<p>‘I ask it, because Monsieur De Miravel is in
danger of his life.’</p>

<p>‘Ah!’ Her heart gave a great leap; she
turned suddenly dizzy, and had to support herself
against the table.</p>

<p>‘I have told this to madame in order that she
may warn Monsieur De Miravel, should she
think well to do so. If he wishes to save his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_806">{806}</span>
life, he must leave here at once—to-night;
to-morrow may be too late.’</p>

<p>Mora was thoroughly bewildered. What she
had just been told had the effect of a stunning
blow upon her; it had come so suddenly that
for a little while her mind failed to realise the
full meaning of the words.</p>

<p>‘What you have just told me is so strange and
terrible,’ she said at last, ‘that you cannot wonder
if I ask you for further particulars. You assert
that M. De Miravel’s life is in danger. What is
it that he has done? What crime has he committed,
that nothing less than his death can
expiate?’</p>

<p>Jules slowly drew in his breath with an
inspiration that sounded like a sigh. What
he was about to tell must be told in a whisper.
‘Throughout Europe, as madame may be aware,
there are certain secret Societies and propaganda,
which, although known by various designations,
have nearly all one great end in view.
Of one such Society Monsieur De Miravel is, and
has been for the last dozen years, an affiliated
member. Nearly a year ago, several brothers
of the Society were arrested, tried, and sentenced
to long terms of imprisonment. Certain
features of the trial proved conclusively that the
arrests were the result of information given by
a spy. There was a traitor in the camp; but
who was he? That question has at length been
answered. It has been proved beyond a doubt
that the traitor is the man who calls himself
Monsieur De Miravel. The sentence on all
traitors is death. De Miravel has been condemned
to die.’</p>

<p>‘This is horrible,’ murmured Mora.</p>

<p>‘It is simple justice, madame.’</p>

<p>‘Has Monsieur De Miravel any knowledge or
suspicion of the terrible fate to which he has
been condemned?’</p>

<p>‘None. How should he have, madame?’</p>

<p>Mora remained lost in thought for a few
moments; then she said: ‘It seems strange that
you, in the position you occupy, should know
all that you have told me, and yet Monsieur
De Miravel himself should know nothing.’</p>

<p>Jules lifted his shoulders almost imperceptibly.
‘It may seem strange to madame; but it is not
so in reality. I, Jules Decroze, the poor <i>garçon</i>,
am a humble brother of that Society which has
condemned the traitor De Miravel to die. I,
too, am affiliated to the sacred cause.’</p>

<p>‘You! Oh!’ Involuntarily she moved a step
or two farther away.</p>

<p>Jules spread out his hands with a little gesture
of deprecation.</p>

<p>‘I hope you don’t run any risk yourself in
telling me what you have told me this evening?’
said Mora after a few seconds of silence.</p>

<p>‘If it were known that I had broken my
oath, as I have broken it but now, I should be
sentenced to the same fate as De Miravel. But
that matters not. I have long owed madame a
debt of gratitude; to-night I have endeavoured to
pay it.’</p>

<p>‘You have more, far more than paid it. You
may have broken your oath, as you say, but you
have done all that lay in your power to save a
fellow-creature’s life.’</p>

<p>‘For your sake, madame—not for his, the
traitor!’ muttered Jules.</p>

<p>If Mora heard, she took no notice. ‘You
must not remain here another moment,’ she said.
‘You have run too much risk already. Perhaps
I may be able to have a few words with you in
private to-morrow. You say that Monsieur De
Miravel must go away at once—to-night?’</p>

<p>‘At once. If he lingers here over to-morrow’—— He
ended with one of his expressive
shrugs.</p>

<p>Mora shuddered. ‘Suppose he refuses to
believe what I tell him, and puts it down as
an invention for the purpose of frightening him
away?’</p>

<p>‘If madame will say these words to him, “<i>The
right hand of the Czar is frozen</i>,” Monsieur
De Miravel will know that she speaks the
truth.’</p>

<p>A moment later the door opened and closed
noiselessly, and Mora was alone.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XV.</h3>

<p>When Hector Laroche was ushered into Sir
William Ridsdale’s room, his eyes blinked involuntarily.
The change from the dusky twilight
outside to the brilliantly lighted apartment in
which he now found himself fairly dazzled him
for the first few seconds.</p>

<p>There were but two people in the room. At
a large square table, covered with papers and
documents written and printed, sat the baronet.
At a smaller table, a little distance away, and
busily writing, sat Colonel Woodruffe—‘the man
of the portrait,’ as Laroche muttered to himself
the moment his eyes lighted on him. Was it
possible that this other man, this white-haired
gentleman, whose gaze was bent so keenly on
him from under his bushy brows, was the great
Sir William himself? He remembered to have
seen this person on more than one occasion walking
about the grounds in the company of Miss
Loraine, but he had never troubled himself to
inquire whom he might be. If he were really
Sir William, then had he been at the hotel for
two or three days, and he, Laroche, had never
discovered that fact. What a blunder!</p>

<p>The Frenchman placed his right hand over
his heart and bowed obsequiously; then he
advanced with slow, cat-like movements towards
the table, but came to a stand while he was yet
some three or four paces away. The keen eyes
of the white-haired gentleman, fixed so persistently
on him, made him feel dreadfully uncomfortable.
He had a great dislike to being stared
at in that way.</p>

<p>‘You are Hector Laroche, <i>ex-déporté</i> No. 897;
and I am Sir William Ridsdale.’</p>

<p>For once his start of surprise was thoroughly
genuine. ‘How! Monsieur knows’——</p>

<p>‘Everything. Madame De Vigne has disclosed
to me the whole dreadful story of her married
life. Her I pity from the bottom of my heart;
but for you, scoundrel, I have no feeling save
one of utter loathing and contempt!’</p>

<p>‘Monsieur’—— whined Laroche with an indescribable
writhing of his long lean body.</p>

<p>‘Silence, fellow!’ said Sir William sternly.
‘It is for you to listen, and not to speak.’ He
rose and crossed to Colonel Woodruffe and spoke
to him in a low voice.</p>

<p>The baronet returned to his seat. ‘It is not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_807">{807}</span>
my intention to say a great deal to you, Monsieur
Laroche,’ resumed Sir William; ‘I wish to rid
myself of your presence as soon as may be; and
what I have to say will be very much to the
purpose.’</p>

<p>Laroche writhed again, but did not speak.
Events had taken a turn so utterly unexpected
by him, the ground had been so completely cut
from under his feet, that he seemed to have
nothing left to say.</p>

<p>‘Madame De Vigne is an Englishwoman, and
as such is entitled to the protection of the laws of
her country. The first point I wish you clearly
to understand is, that her income is settled
strictly upon herself, and that you are not entitled
to claim so much as a single franc of her money.
This time, at least, you will not be allowed to rob
her, as you did once before. The second point
I wish you clearly to understand is, that if you
in any way harm, molest, or annoy Madame De
Vigne or her sister, you will very quickly find
yourself within the walls of an English prison,
where you will be able to meditate on your
folly at your leisure. This is a matter which
Madame De Vigne’s friends will look to particularly,
consequently I warn you in time. And
now, having proved all this to you, I am induced,
by certain considerations which in nowise affect
you, to make you an offer which you will probably
see the wisdom of accepting. The conditions
of my offer are these: You shall at
once quit England and never set foot in it
again; you shall neither write to Madame De
Vigne nor seek to hold any communication of
any kind whatever with her or any one connected
with her. In return for your faithful
obedience to these instructions, you shall be paid
an annuity of three thousand francs a year. The
sum shall be paid you in quarterly instalments
by my Paris agent, to whom you will present
yourself in person once every three months.
When you cease to present yourself, it shall be
considered either that you no longer care to claim
the annuity or that you are dead. Such is the
offer I have to make you, Monsieur Laroche;
you can either accept it or decline it at your
own good pleasure; for my own part I care not
which you do.’</p>

<p>Three thousand francs a year! was Laroche’s
first thought. Why, scarcely half an hour ago,
his wife had offered him just double the amount
on precisely the same terms, and he had laughed
in her face. Imbecile that he had been!</p>

<p>Coward though he was at heart, as nearly all
braggarts are, if Laroche just then had happened
to possess a revolver, he would have felt strongly
tempted to make use of it and risk the consequences.
How he hated those two men!—one
white-haired, smiling, benevolent-looking, as he
had seen him walking about the grounds, but
with such a hand of iron hidden in his velvet
glove; the other stern, impassive, coldly contemptuous,
who had taken no more notice of
him during the interview than if he were a dog.
Yes, he hated them both with the ferocious hatred
of a tiger balked of the prey in which its claws
are already fixed.</p>

<p>This other man he felt nearly sure was in
love with his wife; and he was just as certain
that Mora De Vigne was in love with him.
Even at a time like that, it thrilled him with a
malicious joy to think that so long as he, Laroche,
was alive they could never be more to each other
than they were now. Perhaps if he had not
appeared on the scene till a month or two later,
they might have been married by that time. If
he had only known—if he had only had the
slightest suspicion that such was the state of
affairs, he would have kept carefully in the background
till the newly wedded couple should have
returned from their honeymoon, and then have
made himself known. That would have been a
revenge worthy of the name. But now——</p>

<p>Sir William’s voice recalled him to realities.
‘Perhaps you wish for a little time before you
make up your mind?’ he said.</p>

<p>Laroche shook his head. His nimble brain
had already taken in the altered state of affairs;
he saw that the day had gone hopelessly against
him, that the battle was lost, and that the only
thing left him to do was to accept from the
conquerors the best terms that he could induce
them to offer. If only he had not refused that
six thousand francs! But to a man in his position
even three thousand francs a year was better,
infinitely better, than nothing. It would at least
suffice to find him in absinth and cigarettes, and
would serve to blunt the keen edge of chronic
impecuniosity.</p>

<p>‘Three thousand francs a year, Sir William!
It is a bagatelle—a mere bagatelle.’</p>

<p>‘Take it or leave it.’</p>

<p>The Frenchman spread out his hands and drew
his shoulders up nearly to his ears. ‘<i>Ma foi!</i>
I have no choice. I must accept.’</p>

<p>‘In that case, nothing more need be said,
except that you will leave here by the first train
to-morrow morning. Here is a bank-note with
which to defray the expenses of your journey;
and here is the address of my agent, on whom
you will please call on Wednesday morning next,
by which time he will be in receipt of my instructions.’
Sir William pushed the note and the
address across the table in the direction of Laroche
as though the latter were some plague-stricken
creature with whom he was fearful of coming into
closer contact.</p>

<p>The Frenchman advanced a step or two, picked
up the papers, and put them away slowly and
carefully inside his pocket-book, looking the
baronet full in the eyes as he did so. His teeth
were hard set, and his breath came and went
with a fuller rise and fall than usual, but otherwise
there was nothing to betray the tempest
of passion at work within him. When he had
put his pocket-book away again, and still with
his eyes bent full on the baronet, he said in a
low, deep voice: ‘It is possible, Sir William,
that we may some day meet again.’ Then with
a nod, that might mean much or that might have
no meaning at all, he turned and walked slowly
out of the room.</p>

<p>The Frenchman found Nanette waiting for
him in the corridor. ‘If you please, monsieur,
my mistress desires to see you in her room
immediately on a matter of much importance.’</p>

<p>‘Can it be that she is going to renew the
offer of the six thousand francs?’ was the first
question that Laroche asked himself. Checkmated
at every turn though he had been, and
though all his fine castles in the air had come
tumbling about his ears, he began to hope<span class="pagenum" id="Page_808">{808}</span>
that more might be saved from the wreck than
had seemed probable only a few minutes ago,
and it was not without a certain revival of
spirits and a certain return to his old braggadocio
manner that he followed Nanette to Madame De
Vigne’s room. Just as he was passing the staircase
window, the lightning’s lurid scroll unrolled
itself for an instant against the walls of blackness
outside. Laroche shuddered, he knew not why.
A moment or two later he found himself once
more in the presence of his wife. In the interim,
the lamp had been lighted and the curtains
drawn.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="A_FEW_NOTES_ON_PERSIAN_ART">A FEW NOTES ON PERSIAN ART.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> limner’s art in Persia has few patrons, and
the professional draughtsman of the present day
in that country must needs be an enthusiast,
and an art-lover for art’s sake, as his remuneration
is so small as to be a mere pittance; and the
man who can live by his brush must be clever
indeed. The Persians are an eminently practical
people, and buy nothing unless it be of actual
utility; hence the artist has generally to sink to
the mere decorator; and as all, even the very
rich, expect a great deal for a little money, the
work must be scamped in order to produce a
great effect for a paltry reward. The artists,
moreover, are all self-taught, or nearly so,
pupilage merely consisting of the drudgery of
preparing the canvas, panel, or other material
for the master, mixing the colours, filling in backgrounds,
varnishing, &amp;c. There are no schools of
art, no lectures, no museums of old or contemporary
masters, no canons of taste, no drawing
from nature or the model, no graduated studies,
or system of any kind. There is, however, a
certain custom of adhering to tradition and the
conventional; and most of the art-workmen of
Iran, save the select few, are mere reproducers of
the ideas of their predecessors.</p>

<p>The system of perspective is erroneous; but
neither example nor argument can alter the views
of a Persian artist on this subject. Leaving aside
the wonderful blending of colours in native carpets,
tapestries, and embroideries, all of which
improve by the toning influence of age, the
modern Persian colourist is remarkable for his
skill in the constant use of numerous gaudy and
incongruous colours, yet making one harmonious
and effective whole, which surprises us by its
daring, but compels our reluctant admiration.</p>

<p>Persian pictorial art is original, and it is cheap;
the wages of a clever artist are about one shilling
and sixpence a day. In fact, he is a mere day-labourer,
and his terms are, so many days’ pay
for a certain picture. In this pernicious system
of time-work lies the cause of the scamping of
many really ingenious pieces of work.</p>

<p>As a copyist the Persian is unrivalled; he has
a more than Chinese accuracy of reproduction;
every copy is a fac-simile of its original, the detail
being scamped, or the reverse, according to the
scale of payment. In unoriginal work, such as
the multiplication of some popular design, a man
will pass a lifetime, because he finds it pay better
to do this than to originate. This kind of unoriginal
decoration is most frequent in the painted
mirror cases and book-covers, the designs of which
are ancient; and the painter merely reproduces
the successful and popular work of some old and
forgotten master.</p>

<p>But where the Persian artist shines is in his
readiness to undertake any style or subject;
geometrical patterns—and they are very clever
in originating these; scroll-work scenes from the
poets; likenesses, miniatures, paintings of flowers
or birds; in any media, on any substance, oils,
water, or enamel, and painting on porcelain; all
are produced with rapidity, wonderful spirit, and
striking originality. In landscape, the Persian is
very weak; and his attempts at presenting the
nude, of which he is particularly fond, are mostly
beneath contempt. A street scene will be painted
in oils and varnished to order ‘in a week’ on a
canvas a yard square, the details of the painting
desired being furnished in conversation. While
the patron is speaking, the artist rapidly makes an
outline sketch in white paint; and any suggested
alterations are made in a few seconds by the facile
hand of the <i>ustad nakosh</i> (master-painter), a term
used to distinguish the artist from the mere
portrait-painter or <i>akkas</i>, a branch of the profession
much despised by the artists, a body of men
who consider their art a mechanical one, and their
guild no more distinguished than those of other
handicraftsmen.</p>

<p>A Persian artist will always prefer to reproduce
rather than originate, because, as a copy will
sell for the same price as an original, by multiplication
more money can be earned in a certain
time, than by the exercise of originality. Rarely,
among the better class of artists, is anything actually
out of drawing; the perspective is of course
faulty, and resembles that of early specimens of
Byzantine art. Such monstrosities as the making
the principal personages giants, and the subsidiaries
dwarfs, are common; while the beauties
are represented as much bejewelled; but this is
done to please the buyer’s taste, and the artist
knows its absurdity. There is often considerable
weakness as to the rendering of the extremities;
but as the Persian artist never draws, save in portraiture,
from the life, this is not to be wondered
at.</p>

<p>The writer has before him a fair instance of
the native artist’s rendering of the scene at the
administration of the bastinado. This picture is
an original painting in oils, twenty-four inches
by sixteen, on <i>papier-mâché</i>. The details were
given to the artist by the writer in conversation,
sketched by him in white paint on the <i>papier-mâché</i>
during the giving of the order, in the
course of half an hour; and the finished picture
was completed, varnished, and delivered in a
week. The price paid for this original work in
oils in 1880 was seven shillings and sixpence.
The costumes are quite accurate in the minutest
detail; the many and staring colours employed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_809">{809}</span>
are such as are in actual use; while the general
<i>mise en scène</i> is very correct.</p>

<p>Many similar oil-paintings were executed for
the writer by Persian artists, giving graphic
renderings of the manners and customs of this
little-known country. They were always equally
spirited, and minutely correct as to costume and
detail, at the same low price; a small present
for an extraordinarily successful performance
gladdening the heart of the artist beyond his
expectations.</p>

<p>As to original work by Persian artists in water-colour,
remuneration is the same—so much per
diem. A series of water-colours giving minute
details of Persian life were wished; and a clever
artist was found as anxious to proceed as the
writer was eager to obtain the sketches. The
commission was given, and the subjects desired
carefully indicated to the artist, who, by a rapid
outline sketch in pencil, showed his intelligence
and grasp of the subject. The writer, delighted at
the thought of securing a correct and permanent
record of the manners and customs of a little-known
people, congratulated himself. But, alas!
he counted his chickens before hatching; for the
artist, on coming with his next water-colour,
demanded, and received, a double wage. A
similar result followed the finishing of each
drawing; and though the first only cost three
shillings, and the second six, the writer was
reluctantly compelled to stop his commissions,
after paying four times the price of the first for
his third water-colour, on the artist demanding
twenty-four shillings for a fourth—not that the
work was more, but as he found himself appreciated,
the wily painter kept to arithmetical progression
as his scale of charge; a very simple
principle, which all artists must devoutly wish
they could insist on.</p>

<p>For a reduced copy of a rather celebrated
painting, of which the figures were life-size, of
what might be called, comparatively speaking, a
Persian old master—for this reduction, in oils,
fourteen inches by eight, and fairly well done,
the charge was a sovereign. The piece was
painted on a panel. The subject is a royal
banqueting scene in Ispahan—the date a century
and a half ago. The dresses are those of the
time—the ancient court costume of Persia. The
king in a brocaded robe is represented seated on
a carpet at the head of a room, his drinking-cup
in his hand; while his courtiers are squatted
in two rows at the sides of the room, and are
also carousing. Minstrels and singers occupy the
foreground of the picture; and a row of handsome
dancing-girls form the central group. All
the figures are portraits of historical personages;
and in the copy, the likenesses are faithfully
retained.</p>

<p>The palaces of Ispahan are decorated with
large oil-paintings by the most eminent Persian
artists of their day. All are life-size, and none
are devoid of merit. Some are very clever, particularly
the likenesses of Futteh Ali Shah and
his sons, several of whom were strikingly like
their father. As Futteh Ali Shah had an acknowledged
family of seventy-two, this latter fact is
curious. These paintings are without frames,
spaces having been made in the walls to receive
them. The Virgin Mary is frequently represented
in these mural paintings; also a Mr Strachey, a
young diplomate who accompanied the English
mission to Persia in the reign of our Queen
Elizabeth, is still admired as a type of adolescent
beauty. He is represented with auburn hair in
the correct costume of the period; and copies of
his portrait are still often painted on the pen-cases
of amateurs. These pen-cases, or <i>kalamdans</i>,
are the principal occupation of the miniature-painter.
As one-fourth of the male population
of Persia can write, and as each man has one or
more pen-cases, the artist finds a constant market
for his wares in their adornment. The pen-case
is a box of <i>papier-mâché</i> eight inches long, an
inch and a half broad, and the same deep. Some
of them, painted by artists of renown, are of great
value, forty pounds being a common price to
pay for such a work of art by a rich amateur.
Several fine specimens may be seen in the Persian
Collection at the South Kensington Museum. It
is possible to spend a year’s hard work on the
miniatures painted on a pen-case. These are very
minute and beautiful. The writer possesses a
pen-case painted during the lifetime of Futteh
Ali Shah, a king of Persia who reigned long and
well. All the faces—none more than a quarter
of an inch in diameter—are likenesses; and the
long black beard of the king reaching to his
waist, is not exaggerated, for such beards are
common in Persia.</p>

<p>Bookbinding in Persia is an art, and not a
trade; and here the flower and bird painter finds
his employment. Bright bindings of boards with
a leather back are decorated by the artist, principally
with presentments of birds and flowers,
both being a strange mixture of nature and
imagination; for if a Persian artist in this branch
thinks that he can improve on nature in the
matter of colour, he attempts it. The most
startling productions are the result; his nightingales
being birds of gorgeous plumage, and the
colours of some of his flowers saying much for
his imagination. This method of ‘painting the
lily’ is common in Persia; for the narcissus—bouquets
of which form the constant ornament
in spring of even the poorest homes—is usually
‘improved’ by rings of coloured paper, silk, or
velvet being introduced over the inner ring of
petals. Startling floral novelties are the result;
and the European seeing them for the first time,
is invariably deceived, and cheated into admiration
of what turns out afterwards to be a transparent
trick. Of course, this system of binding
each book in an original cover of its own,
among a nation so literary as the Persians, gives
a continuous and healthy impetus to the art of
the flower-painter.</p>

<p>Enamelling in Persia is a dying art. The best
enamels are done on gold, and often surrounded
by a ring or frame of transparent enamel, grass-green
in colour. This green enamel, or rather
transparent paste, is supposed to be peculiar to
the Persian artist. At times, the gold is hammered
into depressions, which are filled with designs
in enamel on a white paste, the spaces between
the depressions being burnished gold. Large
<i>plaques</i> are frequently enamelled on gold for the
rich; and often the golden water-pipes are
decorated with enamels, either alone, or in combination
with incrusted gems.</p>

<p>Yet another field remains to the Persian artist—that
of engraving on gold, silver, brass, copper,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_810">{810}</span>
and iron. Here the work is usually artistically
good, and always original, no two pieces being
alike.</p>

<p>Something must be said about the artist and
his studio. Abject poverty is the almost universal
lot of the Persian artist. He is, however,
an educated man, and generally well read. His
marvellous memory helps him to retain the traditional
attributes of certain well-known figures:
the black-bearded Rūstum (the Persian Hercules),
and his opponent the Deev Suffid or White
Demon; Leila and Mujnūn, the latter of whom
retired to the wilderness for love of the beautiful
Leila; and in a painfully attenuated state, all
his ribs being very apparent, is always represented
as conversing with the wild beasts, who
sit around him in various attitudes of respectful
attention. Dr Tanner could never hope to reach
the stage of interesting emaciation to which
the Persian artists represent Mujnūn to have
attained. Another popular subject is that of
Solomon in all his glory.</p>

<p>These legends are portrayed with varying art
but unquestionable spirit, and often much
humour; while the poetical legends of the
mythical history of ancient Persia, full of strange
imagery, find apt illustrators in the Persian
artist. The palmy days of book-illustration have
departed; the cheap reprints of Bombay have
taken away the <i>raison d’être</i> of the caligraphist
and book-illustrators, and the few really great
artists who remain are employed by the present
Shah in illustrating his great copy of the <i>Arabian
Nights</i> by miniatures which emulate the beauty
and detail of the best specimens of ancient
monkish art, or in making bad copies of European
lithographs to ‘adorn’ the walls of the royal
palaces.</p>

<p>As for the painter’s studio, it is usually a
bare but light apartment, open to the winds,
in a corner of which, on a scrap of matting, the
artist kneels, sitting on his heels. (It tires an
oriental to sit in a chair.) A tiny table a foot
high holds all his materials; his paints are mixed
on a tile; and his palette is usually a bit of
broken crockery. His brushes he makes himself.
Water-pipe in mouth—a luxury that even an
artist can afford, in a country where tobacco is
fourpence a pound—his work held on his knee
in his left hand, without a mahl-stick or the
assistance of a colour-man, the artist squats contentedly
at his work. He is ambitious, proud of
his powers, and loves his art for art’s sake.
Generally, he does two classes of work—the one
the traditional copies of the popular scenes before
described, or the painting on pen-cases—by this
he lives; the other purely ideal, in which he
deals with art from a higher point of view, and
practises the particular branch which he affects.</p>

<p>As a painter of likenesses, the Persian seldom
succeeds in flattering. The likeness is assuredly
obtained; but the sitter is usually ‘guyed,’ and
a caricature is generally the result. This is not
the case in the portraits of females, and in the
ideal heads of women and children. The large
dreamy eye and long lashes, the full red lips, and
naturally high colour, the jetty or dark auburn
locks (a colour caused by the use of henna, a dye)
of the Persian women in their natural luxuriance,
lend themselves to the successful production of
the peculiarly felicitous representation of female
beauty in which the Persian artist delights.
Accuracy in costume is highly prized, and the
minutiæ of dress are indicated with much aptness,
the varied pattern of a shawl or scarf being
rendered with almost Chinese detail. Beauty of the
brunette type is the special choice of the
artist and amateur, and ‘salt’—as a high-coloured
complexion is termed—is much admired.</p>

<p>Like the ancient Byzantine artist, the Persian
makes a free use of gold and silver in his work.
When wishing to represent the precious metals,
he first gilds or silvers the desired portion of the
canvas or panel, and then with a fine brush puts
in shadows, &amp;c. In this way a strangely magnificent
effect is produced. The presentments of
mailed warriors are done in this way; and the
jewelled chairs, thrones, and goblets in which the
oriental mind delights. Gilt backgrounds, too,
are not uncommon, and their effect is far from
displeasing.</p>

<p>The painting of portraits of Mohammed, Ali,
Houssein, and Hassan—the last three, relatives of
the Prophet, and the principal martyred saints
in the Persian calendar, is almost a trade in itself,
though the representation of the human form is
contrary to the Mohammedan religion, and the
saints are generally represented as veiled and faceless
figures. Yet in these particular cases, custom
has over-ridden religious law, and the <i>Schamayūl</i>
(or portrait of Ali) is common. He is represented
as a portly personage of swarthy hue; his dark
and scanty beard, which is typical of the family
of Mohammed, crisply curled; his hand is grasping
his sword; and he is usually depicted as
wearing a green robe and turban (the holy colour
of the <i>Seyyuds</i> or descendants of the Prophet). A
nimbus surrounds his head; and he is seated on
an antelope’s skin, for the Persians say that skins
were used in Arabia before the luxury of carpets
was known there.</p>

<p>Humble as is the lot of the Persian artist, he
expects to be treated by the educated with consideration,
and would be terribly hurt at any
want of civility. One well-known man, Agha
Abdullah of Shiraz, generally insisted on regaling
the writer with coffee, which he prepared himself
when his studio was visited. To have declined
this would have been to give mortal offence. On
one of these visits, his little brasier of charcoal
was nearly extinguished, and the host had recourse
to a curious kind of fire-igniter, reviver, or rather
steam-blast, that as yet is probably undescribed
in books. It was of hammered copper, and
had a date on it that made it three hundred
years old. It was fairly well modelled; and
this curious domestic implement was in the
similitude of a small duck preening its breast;
consequently, the open beak, having a spout
similar to that of a tea-kettle, was directed
downwards. The Persian poured an ounce or so
of water into the copper bird, and placed it on
the expiring embers. Certainly the result was
surprising. In a few minutes the small quantity
of water boiled fiercely; a jet of steam was
emitted from the open bill, and very shortly the
charcoal was burning brightly. The water having
all boiled away, the Persian triumphantly removed
this scientific bellows with his tongs, and prepared
coffee.</p>

<p>No mention has been made of the curious
bazaar pictures, sold for a few pence. These cost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_811">{811}</span>
little, but are very clever, and give free scope for
originality, which is the great characteristic of
the Persian artist. They consist of studies of
town-life, ideal pictures of dancing-girls, and
such-like. All are bold, ingenious, and original.
But bazaar pictures would take a chapter to
themselves, and occupy more space than can be
spared.</p>

<h3 title="CONCLUSION.">IN FOUR CHAPTERS.—CONCLUSION.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> must ask the reader to accompany us to Bury
Street, St James’s, and learn how Miss Jones has
borne the calamity of her lodger’s good fortune;
for calamity Martha considered the munificent
legacy of Colonel Redgrave, so far as her own
matrimonial prospects were concerned. If these
prospects were dubious prior to his death, they
were now nearly hopeless. This was a fact the
housekeeper was unable to conceal from herself,
in spite of her efforts to take a sanguine view
of affairs. The letters of Septimus were more
business-like than ever; and Miss Jones agreed
with her mother that if Septimus chose to contract
a matrimonial alliance, they would be powerless
to interpose the smallest obstacle to prevent it.
About this time, Mr Bradbury, the second occupant
of apartments in Bury Street, returned from
Monaco, where he had been spending his annual
vacation. Mr Bradbury was a lawyer and a
bachelor, and about sixty-five years of age. He
was in no respect a favourite with Miss Jones,
who in the course of a long residence had learned
some of the faults and failings of her legal tenant.
The most important of these was a love of
gambling. At times, the mental depression of
the lawyer was so excessive, that Martha entertained
fears that he would be guilty of some rash
act which would render notorious the hitherto
quiet house in Bury Street. But a sudden turn
in Fortune’s wheel would disperse the mental
clouds of the gambler, and he would resume
his usual cheerful manner and speech. On the
evening of his arrival from Monaco, he dined
in a more than usual <i>recherché</i> manner, and when
the dessert had been placed on the table, he
requested the presence of Miss Jones for a brief
space, to discuss a very important matter of
business. Mr Bradbury was a thin, spare man,
with keen restless gray eyes, which took in the
surroundings at a glance. He sat in his luxurious
armchair, with his feet crossed on a footstool,
and as he held up a glass of ’47 port to the light
of the chandelier, he looked the picture of comfort
and happy enjoyment. Yet was the mind
of that man racked with consuming cares, for
he had had a bad time of it at Monaco, and he
had not only lost his own cash, but a considerable
sum belonging to other people, in the
shape of trust moneys, &amp;c. He requested Miss
Jones to be seated, also to take a glass of wine.
Miss Jones complied with the first request, but
declined the second.</p>

<p>‘I have only learned the death of Colonel
Redgrave at Shanklin since my return to London.
I must have accidentally omitted at Monaco reading
that portion of the <i>Times</i> which contained
the announcement. On a memorable occasion I
transacted some legal business for him. My fellow-lodger
Mr Redgrave appears to have tumbled into
a good thing in the shape of a very handsome
legacy.’ Mr Bradbury paused a moment; but
Miss Jones made no response, but sat with her
large black eyes fixed on the twitching features
of the lawyer, who was now evidently under the
influence of strong excitement. ‘I have not lived
all these years under your comfortable roof, Miss
Jones, without becoming acquainted with the
special relations which exist between Mr Redgrave
and yourself.’ Again the lawyer paused,
in expectation of Miss Jones making some
reply. ‘I mean that I have ever considered
Miss Jones as the certain and future Mrs Redgrave.’</p>

<p>‘You can hardly expect me, Mr Bradbury, to
answer such a statement,’ replied Martha in a
somewhat severe tone.</p>

<p>‘I cannot. But it is necessary that I should
assume such to be the case. You do not deny
it? Now, I can put twenty thousand pounds into
the scale which contains your right to become
Mrs Redgrave, and I can deprive him of that
amount, if he declines to make you his wife. I
do not wish to speak against your future husband,
but he is selfish and avaricious, and I think he
will succumb to the temptation I have it in my
power to lay before him. A short time before
I started for Monaco, Colonel Redgrave called
on me at my office. I had known him many
years ago in India. He desired me to draw up
a will, in which he revoked the bequest to Mr
Septimus Redgrave <i>in toto</i>. He had not been
prepossessed with his cousin latterly; in fact,
he had conceived the most intense dislike for
him. He preferred that I should execute the
will, instead of employing Mr Lockwood, the
son of the late family lawyer, for what reason
I know not.’ Mr Bradbury rose from his
chair, and unlocking a small cabinet, produced
a folded parchment suitably indorsed. ‘Here
is the veritable last will and testament of the
late <span class="smcap">Colonel Redgrave</span>, in which the date
and purport of the previous will are specially
mentioned, duly signed and properly witnessed,
I need scarcely say. If I were to put it in
yonder fire, nothing could disturb Mr Redgrave
in the enjoyment of his legacy. Now,
I am going to place implicit confidence in your
honour, Miss Jones. I shall require ten per
cent., or two thousand pounds. You shall
require the hand in marriage of Mr Septimus
Redgrave. Should he refuse these terms, this
will shall be enforced, and Mr Redgrave loses
twenty thousand pounds, and a lady who, I am
convinced, would make him an excellent wife.
You will naturally say: “Why should Mr Bradbury
run the risk of penal servitude for such a
sum as two thousand pounds?” In reply, I
deny that I run any risk, and that sum of money
will stave off heavier consequences than I care to
name.’</p>

<p>It would be difficult to describe the whirlwind
of mental emotion which agitated the bosom of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_812">{812}</span>
Martha as she listened to the harangue of the
lawyer. On the one hand she saw the possibility
of realising her life-long ambition, of becoming
the wife of a man with an income of nearly
two thousand a year, not to speak of the social
position attending it. Martha remembered reading
a novel by one of the most popular authors
of our time, wherein the heroine committed a
far more heinous offence with respect to a will
than its mere suppression, and yet the delinquent
preserved not only the love and esteem of all the
characters of the tale, but even the good opinion
of the readers thereof.</p>

<p>The lawyer watched the flushed cheek of his
listener with feelings of hope, and plied poor
Martha with such specious arguments as to the
nullity of risk and the immense gain to be derived
from the prosecution of his plan, that she at
length consented to proceed to Shanklin by an
early train on the following morning and seek
a private interview with Mr Redgrave. As she
rose to depart, Martha inquired of the lawyer
the name of the fortunate recipient of the legacy.
‘Miss Blanche Fraser,’ was the reply.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr Redgrave was considerably astonished on
the morning following the interview we have
described when Miss Jones was announced.
He pulled out his watch, and finding it wanted
an hour to luncheon, decided to see her at once.
He found Martha in the library. She was pale
and excited. ‘Well, Martha, I hope nothing is
the matter? All well in Bury Street?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, Mr Redgrave. I wish to speak to you in
private.’</p>

<p>‘Well, speak away, Martha,’ retorted Septimus,
somewhat testily.</p>

<p>‘Pardon me; walls have ears. Can we not go
into the grounds?’</p>

<p>Septimus paused a moment, surprised at the
request, but presently assented. He led the way
through the hall, and finally stopped in a small
orchard adjoining the garden. ‘Now, Martha,
you can speak with as much security as if you
were in the middle of Salisbury Plain.’</p>

<p>‘I am the bearer of ill news.’</p>

<p>Septimus turned pale as he beheld the unaccustomed
expression of the features of the speaker.</p>

<p>‘But it is in my power to ward off the blow,
or, I should say, in <i>your</i> power. I will come to
the point at once. The late Colonel Redgrave
employed Mr Bradbury to make a subsequent
will, in which he annulled the will by which
you inherit your legacy.’</p>

<p>Septimus felt his knees tremble beneath him,
his teeth chattered, and he staggered towards a
garden-seat which was close at hand.</p>

<p>Martha beheld with satisfaction the effect of
the communication upon her auditor.</p>

<p>He gasped forth: ‘And who is the legatee?’</p>

<p>‘Miss Blanche Fraser.’</p>

<p>‘Gracious powers! The lady to whom I proposed!’
These words were not lost on Martha.
They gave her increased determination to proceed
with her dangerous mission.</p>

<p>‘You can still retain the fortune, if you will
perform an act of tardy justice.’</p>

<p>‘What do you mean?’ exclaimed Septimus,
with a lurking suspicion of the nature of the
act required.</p>

<p>‘Listen patiently for a few moments. For
twenty-five years you have been a resident under
my mother’s roof; during fifteen years of that
time you have treated me as something more than
a housekeeper; you have treated me as a friend.
In return, I have been to you as a sister. I have
watched over your comforts in health, have
nursed you in sickness, and wasted all my young
days in waiting for the moment when you would
reward my life-long devotion by making me your
wife.’</p>

<p>‘My wife!’ retorted Septimus angrily. ‘Ridiculous!’</p>

<p>‘Unless you do so,’ pursued Martha, ‘the second
will will be put in force.’</p>

<p>‘And how do you propose to set aside that
will, if you become my wife?’ exclaimed Septimus.</p>

<p>‘By simply putting it into the fire,’ replied
Martha in a calm decided tone.</p>

<p>Now, it was almost instantaneously apparent
to Martha that both she and Mr Bradbury had
displayed a deplorable lack of judgment, when
they unanimously came to the conclusion that
Septimus Redgrave would eagerly seize the bait
held out to him by the destruction of the second
will. Selfish and avaricious he might be, but
not sufficiently so to induce him to stain his
conscience with the commission of so great a crime
as that suggested to him by a man in dire
extremity, and a woman who hoped to realise
her life-long ambition by one grand <i>coup</i>.</p>

<p>‘You cannot mean what you say, Miss Jones,
at least I hope not,’ exclaimed Septimus in a
severe tone. ‘You have been led into this by
that man Bradbury, whom I have always considered
a great scoundrel.’</p>

<p>‘You refuse my offer then?’ said Martha in
a voice pregnant with despair.</p>

<p>‘I will not condescend to answer you,’ said
Septimus. ‘You had better return at once to
London. I cannot offer you any hospitality.
In the first place, my sisters have a strong prejudice
against you, which I must say is not
without warrant; and in the second place, I am
engaged to be married to the mother of the
fortunate legatee. So, if I do not become the
possessor of the wealth of the late Colonel Redgrave,
my wife’s daughter will inherit; so the
money will still be in the family.—Good-morning.’</p>

<p>Septimus bowed, and would have left the
unhappy Martha without further speech; but
the housekeeper caught him by the arm, as she
cried in hoarse accents: ‘At least you will promise
never to mention to any human being the
scheme I proposed for your benefit?’</p>

<p>‘I promise,’ curtly replied Septimus, and left
the orchard without more ado, the wretched
Martha gazing after his retreating figure with
features on which despair in its acutest phase
was deeply written.</p>

<p>We have but little to add respecting the personages
who have figured in our tale. Mrs Fraser
was, as the reader will readily imagine, inexpressibly
mortified at so suddenly losing the legacy
bequeathed by the late Colonel Redgrave. But
if anything could soften the blow, it was the fact
that the fortunate recipient was her only child,

<h2 class="nobreak" id="WHATS_IN_A_NAME">WHAT’S IN A NAME?</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> we are told that ‘a rose by any other
name would smell as sweet,’ the fact appears to
be self-evident. Yet there was a time when
there was something in a name. We have
abundant evidence from the history of the
ancients, and from observations of savage tribes,
to show that they believed in some inseparable
and mysterious connection between a name and
the object bearing it, which has given rise to a
remarkable series of superstitions, some of which
have left traces even amongst ourselves.</p>

<p>The Jews believed that the name of a child
would have a great influence in shaping its
career; and we have a remarkable instance of
this sort of superstition in quite a different
quarter of the world. Catlin, the historian of
the Canadian Indians, tells us that when he was
among the Mohawks, an old chief, by way of
paying him a great compliment, insisted on
conferring upon him his own name, <i>Cayendorongue</i>.
‘He had been,’ Catlin explains, ‘a
noted warrior; and told me that now I had a
right to assume to myself all the acts of valour
he had performed, and that now my name would
echo from hill to hill over all the Five Nations.’</p>

<p>The generosity of the Mohawk chief will
doubtless be more appreciated when we observe
that it is seldom the superstition takes the form
of giving one’s name away as in his case; on the
contrary, most savages are very much opposed to
mentioning their names. A well-known writer
points out that the Indians of British Columbia
have a strange prejudice against telling their
own names, and his observation is confirmed by
travellers all over the world. In many tribes,
if the indiscreet question is asked them, they
will nudge their neighbour and get him to answer
for them. The mention of a name by the unwary
has sometimes been followed by unpleasant
results. We are told, for instance, by Mr Blackhouse,
of a native lady of Van Diemen’s Land
who stoned an English gentleman for having,
in his ignorance of Tasmanian etiquette, casually
mentioned the name of one of her sons. Nothing
will induce a Hindu woman to mention the
name of her husband; in alluding to him she
uses a variety of descriptive epithets, such as
‘the master,’ &amp;c., but avoids his proper name
with as scrupulous care as members of the
House of Commons when speaking of each
other in the course of debate. Traces of this
may be seen even in Scotland; one may often
come across women in rural districts who are
in the habit of speaking of their husbands by
no other name than ‘he.’ To such an extent
is this superstition carried among some savage
tribes, that the real names of children are concealed
from their birth upwards, and they are
known by fictitious names until their death.</p>

<p>The fear of witchcraft probably is the explanation
of all those superstitions. If a name gets
known to a sorcerer, he can use it as a handle
wherewith to work his spells upon the bearer.
When the Romans laid siege to a town, they
set about at once to discover the name of its
tutelary deity, so that they might coax the god
into surrendering his charge. In order to prevent
their receiving the same treatment at the
hands of their enemies, they carefully concealed
the name of the tutelary deity of Rome, and are
said to have killed Valerius Soranus for divulging
it. We have several examples in our nursery
tales of the concealment of a name being connected
with a spell. It is made use of by
Wagner in the plot of his opera of <i>Lohengrin</i>,
where the hero, yielding to the curiosity of his
lady-love, divulges the secret of his name, and
has in consequence to leave her and return to a
state of enchantment. In Grimm’s tale of <i>The
Gold Spinner</i>, again, we have an instance of a
spell being broken by the discovery of the
sorcerer’s name.</p>

<p>Reluctance to mention names reaches its height
in the case of dangerous or mysterious agencies.
In Borneo, the natives avoid naming the smallpox.
In Germany, the hare must not be named,
or the rye-crop will be destroyed; and to mention
the name of this innocent animal at sea, is, or
was, reckoned by the Aberdeenshire fishermen
an act of impiety, the punishment of which to
be averted only by some mysterious charm. The
Laplanders never mention the name of the bear,
but prefer to speak of him as ‘the old man with
the fur-coat.’ The motive here appears to be
a fear that by naming the dreaded object his
actual presence will be evoked; and this idea
is preserved in one of our commonest sayings.
Even if the object of terror does not actually
appear, he will at least listen when he hears his
name; and if anything unpleasant is said of him
he is likely to resent it. Hence, in order to avoid
even the semblance of reproach, his very name
is made flattering. This phenomenon, generally
termed euphemism, is of very common occurrence.
The Greeks, for example, called the Furies the
‘Well-disposed ones;’ and the wicked fairy Puck
was christened ‘Robin Goodfellow’ by the English
peasantry. The modern Greeks euphemise the
name of vinegar into ‘the sweet one.’ Were its
real name to be mentioned, all the wine in the
house would turn sour. We have an example
of the converse of the principle of euphemism<span class="pagenum" id="Page_814">{814}</span>
at work in the case of mothers among the savage
tribes of Tonquin giving their children hideous
names in order to frighten away evil spirits
from molesting them.</p>

<p>It is, however, in the case of the most dreaded
and most mysterious of all our enemies—Death—that
the superstition becomes most apparent.
‘The very name of Death,’ says Montaigne,
‘strikes terror into people, and makes them
cross themselves.’ Even the unsuperstitious have
a vague reluctance to mentioning this dreaded
name. Rather than say, ‘If Mr So-and-so should
<i>die</i>,’ we say, ‘If anything should happen to Mr
So-and-so.’ The Romans preferred the expression
‘He has lived’ to ‘He is dead.’ ‘M. Thiers
<i>a vécu</i>’ was the form in which that statesman’s
death was announced; not ‘M. Thiers <i>est mort</i>.’</p>

<p>The same reluctance is noticeable in mentioning
the names of persons who are dead. A writer
on the Shetland Isles tells us that no persuasion
will induce a widow to mention her dead
husband’s name. When we do happen to allude
to a deceased friend by name, we often add some
such expression as ‘Rest his soul!’ by way of
antidote to our rashness; and this expression
seems to have been used by the Romans in the
same way. As might be expected, we find this
carried to a great extreme among savages. In
some tribes, when a man dies who bore the name
of some common object—‘fire,’ for instance—the
name for fire must be altered in consequence;
and as proper names among savages are almost
invariably the names of common objects, the rapid
change that takes place in the language and the
inconvenience resulting therefrom may be imagined.
Civilisation has indeed made enormous
progress from this cumbersome superstition to
our own philosophy, which can ask with haughty
indifference, ‘What’s in a name?’</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_HAUNTED_BRIDGE">THE HAUNTED BRIDGE.</h2>
</div>
<p class="ph3">A TALE OF THE HIGHLANDS.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are probably few readers who are
not familiar, to a greater or lesser extent, with
the well-ventilated subject of superstition in
the Highlands of Scotland. There are few
mountain countries throughout the world that
are not rich in lore and legend relating to the
supernatural: their very configuration suggests
that agencies more than ordinary have been
employed in shaping out their features. It is
curious to notice how very largely the demoniac
theory enters into the calculations of the
peasantry. For one Fairy glen or knowe there
are a dozen Devil’s mills, bridges, caldrons, or
punchbowls; in fact, it is almost always the
beings that are supposed to be baleful and
inimical to the human race that have had their
personality perpetuated in these legends. This
certainly seems a little incongruous; but as this
is not a treatise on demonology, we are content
to leave it so.</p>

<p>Superstition is part of the being of the mountaineer.
Brave even to rashness, he will face the
natural dangers that beset his life—in the torrent,
on the peak, or in the forest; he fears no odds
when he meets his foes. And yet this man, who
can tread the dizzy ledge on the face of a
precipice, who can hurl himself on levelled steel,
is more timid and frightened than a child, when
he conceives that forces other than earthly are
being brought to bear on him. It is partly to the
style and manner of his life that he owes this.
He is brought more into the presence of nature
than his neighbour of the plains; he becomes
imbued with the spirit of his surroundings; the
deep dark gloom of the woods, the lonesomeness
of the mountain solitudes, the voices of the storm
and of the torrent, and of their reproductions in
the echoes, appeal to him; and a poetical imagination
begotten of such an existence finishes
the process. Thus the roar of a waterfall in
its dark chasm becomes to him the howlings of
some demon prisoned among the rocks; the
sighing of the wind through the forest trees is
caused by the passage of spirits; the mists that
furl around the mountain peaks and are wafted
so silently across crest and corrie are disembodied
ghosts; and the sounds that break the stillness
of the night are the shrieks and yells of fiends
and their victims.</p>

<p>This brings me to my story. I fancy that most
of my readers are acquainted more or less with
the scenery of the Highlands; but in the case
of by far the larger number of them, I venture
to say that such acquaintance extends only to
the Highlands in their summer or their autumn
dress. If so, they only half know them. Brave
is the tourist who ventures amid the bens and
glens when rude King Boreas lords it over them;
when winter’s wind roars adown the gorges of
the hill, staggering the stalwart pines, mingling
the withered leaves and the snowflakes in the
desolate woods. When icicles hang from the
hoary rocks, and the deep drift chokes up the
ravines, mantles the slopes of the corries, and
bends in cornices over the threatening cliffs;
when the river roars through the plain—brown
and swollen—and its parent torrents are leaping
and raving among the boulders; when the
mountain hare and the ptarmigan are white as
the snow that harbours them; and the deer,
driven from the hills by stress of weather, roam
in herds through the low-lying woods; and the
mountain fox leaves his cairn and prowls around
the farm and the sheepfold—<i>then</i>, if you would
enter into the spirit of loneliness and solitude,
take your way to the Highlands. Do not
imagine, however, that such is their condition
during the whole of winter; on the contrary,
I have painted a particularly black picture, and
it was in very much better weather that, two or
three years ago, I went north, in December, on
a visit to some friends in Inverness-shire. The
particular part of the county I stayed in does
not materially affect my adventure, so I shall
not disclose it.</p>

<p>My time sped by very pleasantly, although
the district did not afford many neighbours at
short distances; but this was a circumstance that
always procured me an extra hearty welcome
when I ventured far enough from home to call
upon any people. On one of these expeditions
I had ridden to a house about eight miles away,
and the late hour of my arrival brought about
an invitation to stay for dinner and spend the
evening. My friends pushed their hospitality
to such an extent, that they had almost prevailed
upon me to stay the night as well, when a good-natured
challenge changed my wavering plans<span class="pagenum" id="Page_815">{815}</span>
into a firm determination to be off. Our conversation
after dinner had not unnaturally turned
upon ghost-stories, as the district was an out-of-the-way
one, and the country-folk were fully
persuaded of the existence of kelpies and warlocks
of various kinds. What now happened was that
some of the young people fancied they had found
the reason why I was willing to stay all night,
and boldly told me that I was frightened to cross
a certain bridge on my way home that had the
reputation of being haunted. I knew the spot
well, though I had never found out its exact
story; and when I had assured the country-people
that I had no fears of the experiment,
they solemnly shook their heads, and averred
that not for sums untold would they cross the
bridge after nightfall. On the present occasion,
as I had been foremost among the sceptics
during the story-telling, I felt my reputation
at stake; and declaring I would on no
account remain, I gave orders to have my pony
brought round. The whole party came to the
door to see me start—the elders inveighing
against my foolishness in setting off at that time
of night; the young people plying me with
horrors, and telling me to be sure to come round
next morning—if alive—and give an account of
my adventures. To all I gave a merry reply,
and lighting my pipe, swinging myself into
the saddle, and shouting ‘Good-night,’ I cantered
off down the avenue.</p>

<p>For a couple of miles the road led me down
a deep wooded glen. On both sides the mountains
towered aloft to a height of more than
two thousand feet, their lower slopes thickly
clad with pine and birch, their shoulders and
summits white from a recent heavy snowfall.
The river poured along tumultuously, close
beneath the road, swirling past frowning cliffs
of rock, brawling and battling with heaps of
boulders, shooting in sheets of glancing foam
over cascade and rapid. By daylight the scene
was sufficiently grand and impressive; illumined
as it now was by a faint moonlight, it was much
more so. The night was calm and slightly frosty;
but overhead, a strong breeze was blowing, and
from time to time the moon was obscured by
the flying clouds. The play of light and shade
brought about by this was very beautiful; at
one moment the shaggy hillsides and deep pools
of the river were plunged in deepest shadow;
in the next a flood of pale glory poured over
them, painting the rushing stream with silver,
shooting shafts of light among the tall trees,
tracing mosaics on the dark surface of the road.
Each clump of ferns, each bush and stump, took
uncommon shape, and it required no great stretch
of imagination to convert the boulders and reefs
of rock out in the stream into waterbulls and
kelpies. The rush and roar of the river drowned
all other sounds; but with the exception of the
echoing tread of my pony and the occasional
bark of a fox from the hill, there was nothing
else to be heard. On my way down the glen
I passed a few scattered cottages, but their occupants
were long ago in bed, although it was
not much past ten o’clock.</p>

<p>The wilder part of the glen ended in a fine
pass, where the hills towered almost straight up
from the river, and the pines threw so deep a
shadow, that for a few yards it was impossible
to see the road. Just beyond, the mountains
retreated to right and left, and through a short
and level tract of meadow-land, road and stream
made their way down to the shores of the loch.
Ahead of me I could see its broad bosom glancing
in the moonlight, and the great snow-clad mountains
beyond it. As the improved condition of
the road now made rapid progression easier, I
gave the pony his head, and he went along in a
style that promised soon to land me at my
destination.</p>

<p>There was only one thing that troubled me—the
haunted bridge. Once past it, and I
should thoroughly enjoy my moonlight ride. I
do not know whether it was the thought of the
ghost-stories with which we had beguiled the
hours after dinner, and which now kept recurring
to my mind in spite of all effort to the contrary,
or whether it was the solemn and impressive
scenery I had passed through in the glen, that
had unstrung me; but the nearer I drew to
the bridge the more uncomfortable I felt regarding
it. It was not exactly fear, but a vague
presentiment of evil—the Highland blood asserting
itself. I could not get rid of the sensation.
I tried to hum and to whistle, but the forced
merriment soon died a natural death. I was
now on the loneliest part of the road. From
the bottom of the glen as far as the bridge—about
three miles—there was not a single cottage;
and more than a mile on the other side of
it lay a scattered hamlet. The moon, too, which
had hitherto befriended me, now threatened to
withdraw its light; and where clumps of trees
overhung the road the darkness was deep. The
pony carried me along bravely—he knew he
was going home; and in a short time a turn
in the road showed me, some distance ahead,
a ribbon of white high upon the dark hillside.
It was the stream that ran beneath the fatal
bridge.</p>

<p>Better get out of this as soon as possible, I
thought; and with voice and stick I encouraged
the pony to increased speed. On we went! The
roar of the haunted stream was loud and near
now; the gloom increased as we plunged deeper
into the wood that filled its basin; in another
minute the bridge would be far behind, when,
without the least warning, the pony shied to
one side and then stood stock still, quivering all
over. The shock all but sent me flying over
its head; but by an effort I kept my seat. I
had not far to look for the cause of the beast’s
fright. Not a dozen yards away were the dimly
seen parapets of the bridge; and on one of
them crouched an object that froze me with
terror. There are some moments in which
the events of a lifetime pass in review; there
are some glances in which an infinity of detail
can be taken in quicker than eye can close.
This was one of them. I do not suppose that
my eye rested on the object of my terror for
more than a second; but in that brief space
I saw what seemed like the upper part of a
distorted human body, hunchbacked and without
legs, with a face that glowed with the red light
of fire! I can laugh now, when I think of my
fright; but at the moment, I remember getting
the pony into motion somehow with stick, bridle,
and voice, and speeding across the bridge like a
thunderbolt, crouching down, Tam o’ Shanter-like,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_816">{816}</span>
and momentarily expecting to feel the grip
of a clammy hand on my neck! Hard, hard we
galloped through the hamlet I have mentioned;
nor did I slacken the pace until the lights of
my abode had gleamed through the plantation,
and we were safe and sound in the stable-yard.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To make a really good ghost-story, my narrative
should go no further; but the sequel has
still to be told. I invented an excuse to appease
the curiosity of my friends, who naturally were
anxious to know what had sent us home in
such a fashion—the pony in a lather, and myself
with a scared, unintelligible expression. I did
not want to tell the real story until I had
made some effort to unravel it. With this end
in view, I started on foot soon after breakfast
for the house I had dined at, intending to make
a thorough examination of the bridge and the
course of the stream on my way, and to question
some of the cottagers in the hamlet. I
was saved the trouble, however. I had not gone
much more than a mile, when I perceived coming
along the road towards me a sturdy pedlar,
with a fur cap on his head, and a pack of
very large dimensions fastened on his broad
shoulders. Such fellows are very commonly met
with in the outlying districts of the Highlands,
where they do a roaring trade in ribbons,
sham jewellery, and smallwares, besides carrying
a fund of gossip from place to place. In the
specimen of the class now before me I was not
long in recognising the ghost of the haunted
bridge, and in hailing him I was soon in
possession of the whole story. ‘Yes; he was
the man that was sitting on the brig about
eleven o’clock; and was I the gentleman that
rode past as if all the witches in the countryside
were at his heels? Faith, it was a proper
fright I had given him.’</p>

<p>‘But tell me,’ I asked, ‘what on earth were
you doing there at such a time of night?’</p>

<p>‘Weel, sir, I was very late of gettin’ across
the ferry; and it was a langer step than I
had thocht doon to the village; and I had
had a guid walk the day already, and was tired-like.
The brig was kind o’ handy for a rest;
so I just sat doon on the dike and had a bit
smoke o’ the pipe. Losh, sir, when ye cam
scourin’ past, I thocht it was the deil himsel’;
but then I just thocht that it was mysel’ sitting
in the shadow that had frighted your beastie, and
it had run awa’ wi’ you like. And when I cam
the length o’ the village, I just had to creep
into a bit shed; and wi’ my pack and some
straw I soon made a bed.’</p>

<p>So here was the whole story. The deep
shadow on the bridge had prevented me from
seeing the sitter’s legs; the heavy knapsack had
given him a humpback; the fur cap and the
glow of the pipe accounted for the fiery countenance.
With mutual explanations we parted—he
to push his sales in the villages beyond;
I, to hurry on to the house in the glen, whose
inmates at first evinced the liveliest interest
in the over-night episode—an interest, however,
which waned to disappointment as I proceeded
to explain how the ghost was laid. I may mention
that I omitted the ‘scourin’ past’ portion of
the adventure. How they will chaff me when
they read this!</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg&#8482; works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.&#8221;
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
